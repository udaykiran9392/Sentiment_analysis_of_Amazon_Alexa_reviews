# 🗣️ Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Alexa Reviews using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and classify user sentiments from Amazon Alexa product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether a customer review reflects a positive or negative sentiment, helping brands and sellers gain insights into customer satisfaction.


## 🔍 Overview
In today’s digital age, understanding customer opinions is vital for businesses. This project leverages supervised machine learning to perform sentiment classification on Alexa product reviews. By preprocessing review texts and applying classification models, the system determines user satisfaction levels, helping improve product development and marketing strategies.

## 🧠 Steps Followed
**Data Collection**

Used Amazon Alexa product reviews dataset (publicly available).

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Removed punctuation, stopwords, and performed tokenization and stemming.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed review distribution, word frequency, sentiment distribution.

**Feature Engineering**

Applied TF-IDF vectorization for transforming text data into numerical format.

**Model Training**

Trained and evaluated models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**Model Evaluation**

Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to measure model performance.

**Visualization & Insights**

Visualized most frequent positive and negative terms, sentiment ratio.
